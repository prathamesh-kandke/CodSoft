# Data Science Project for CodSoft Internship

This repository contains the Data Science project completed as part of my internship at **CodSoft**. The project demonstrates data analysis, visualization, and machine learning techniques applied to solve a specific business problem.

## Project Overview

- **Objective**: [State the main goal of the project, e.g., "Analyze sales data," or "Build a recommendation system."]
- **Data Source**: [Briefly describe the dataset, e.g.,"Publicly available dataset from Kaggle," or "Provided by CodSoft."]
- **Tools & Technologies**: [List the tools used, e.g., Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook, etc.]

## Key Features

1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Data cleaning and handling missing values.
   - Feature selection and engineering.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualizations to understand data trends and patterns.
3. **Modeling**:
   - Building and evaluating machine learning models.
   - Hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance.
4. **Insights**:
   - Key takeaways and recommendations based on the analysis.
